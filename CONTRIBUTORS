krom:              Thank you for your indisposable clean-room, micro-test
                   ROMs. These, especially the RSP vector ROMs, have saved me
                   hours of hair-pulling. And, with my impatience, there's no
                   way I would have ever come close to developing something so
                   intricate.

Iconoclast:        Although we hardly ever see eye-to-eye with regards to
                   development practices, your zilmar-spec RSP plugin was
                   instrumental to getting CEN64 to the point where it is
                   today. Without a basis of comparison, the initial SSE-
                   ification of the RSP algorithms would have been even more
                   testing than it already was.

OzOnE/LuigiBlood   For your fantastic documentation and efforts on reversing
                   the 64DD. Without your efforts, there's no way that CEN64
                   would have 64DD support.

AIO:               Thank you for your RSP/SSE optimizations. It's always nice
                   to see someone else's approaches to vectorizing some of the
                   RSP instructions!

#n64dev:           Thank you to everyone else that's helped out in the past:
                   marshallh, mikeryan, balrog, jrra, and anyone else that
                   I'm forgetting.
