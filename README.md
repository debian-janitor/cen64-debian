# About

Yes, _another_ Nintendo 64 emulator. This one, however, aims for _perfect_
emulation by emulating the hardware inside of the Nintendo 64 itself, down
to the register-transfer level (RTL). At the same time, I've tried to keep
things as optimized as possible in hopes that CEN64 will someday run ROMs at
full speed, even on modest systems.

# Why?

CEN64 is my pet project. It's something I pick up whenever I get bored. To me,
what Nintendo and SGI did with this console is nothing short of amazing. The
ingenuity and design of the hardware was well-ahead of it's time, and it is
an absolute blast to reverse-engineer and study. I started this project in
order to learn more about what _really_ went on at the hardware level back in
the (good old) days.

Thank you to every single one of you developers for filling my childhood
with excellent memories. I'd also like to thank the community on all their
hard work and effort spent reverse-engineering this little gem. Without
further ado... "Get N or get out"!
